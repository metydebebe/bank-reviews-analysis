## Task 2: Sentiment and Thematic Analysis

### Overview

This task focuses on analyzing the sentiment of bank reviews and extracting recurring themes to uncover satisfaction drivers and pain points.

### Sentiment Analysis

Goal: Quantify sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of user reviews using the distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english model.

Method:

Use Hugging Face Transformers pipeline for sentiment classification.

Handle neutral sentiment by thresholding confidence scores.

Aggregate sentiment scores by bank and rating.

Output: CSV file with review text, sentiment labels, and scores.

### Thematic Analysis

Goal: Identify 3â€“5 actionable themes per bank from user reviews.

Method:

Preprocess reviews with spaCy (tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization).

Extract keywords and n-grams using spaCy and TF-IDF.

Manually group keywords into themes such as 'Account Access Issues', 'Customer Support', etc.

Assign themes to reviews based on keyword matching.

Output: CSV file including review text, sentiment data, and identified themes.
